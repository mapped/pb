# Go Vanity Url
As you've probably determined this is not a "package" for Go, as golang has no concept of packages - just source in VCS somewhere ðŸ˜’ðŸŽ». You can read more about this at https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/PackagePublishing .

## go.mapped.dev
Rather than point our source code at `github.com/mapped/xyz` we use a vanity url of `go.mapped.dev/xyz`. To do this we need to publish a website that does the redirect. You can read about this at https://sagikazarmark.hu/blog/vanity-import-paths-in-go/ .
